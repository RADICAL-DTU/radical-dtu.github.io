#### **RADICAL — Rational design, synthesis, and operando investigation of atomically dispersed catalysts for electrochemical H₂O₂ production**

The motivation of **RADICAL** is to develop efficient and stable atomically dispersed metal catalysts
(ADMCs) for the electrochemical production of H₂O₂, through deeply integrated theoretical and
experimental studies. Currently, the production of H₂O₂ through the anthraquinone process generates
over **20 million tons** of greenhouse gases and **55 million tons** of chemical waste per year.
