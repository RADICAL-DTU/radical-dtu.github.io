#### RADICAL - Rational design, synthesis, and operando investigation of atomically dispersed catalysts for electrochemical H2O2 production

The motivation of RADICAL is to develop efficient and stable atomically dispersed metal catalysts
(ADMCs) for the electrochemical production of H2O2, through deeply integrated theoretical and
experimental studies. Currently, the production of H2O2 through the anthraquinone process generates
over 20 million tons (Mt) of greenhouse gases and 55 Mt of chemical waste per year
