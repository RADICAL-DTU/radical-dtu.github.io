#### **Research**

The objectives of RADICAL are defined as 

1) To devise a synthesis process for preparing atomically dispersed metal catalysts
with homogeneous and well-defined active site structures, 

2) To establish the structure-activity-stability
relationships of atomically dispersed metal catalysts for electrochemical H₂O₂ production

3) To develop atomically dispersed metal catalysts
with the following performance criteria verified in HPNow reactors: faradaic efficiency > 60 %, total
cell voltage < 1.6 V, cathode potential > 0.1 V at the current density of 100 mA cm-2, and a
degradation of catalyst activity and selectivity below 5% after 750 hours of operation.
